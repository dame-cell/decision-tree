# Introduction on Decision Trees

## Decision trees:
 Decision trees are built by recursively partitioning data based on features to maximize information gain or minimize impurity. The algorithm creates a tree-like structure, where each node represents a decision based on a feature value. The process continues until a stopping criterion is met. At the end, leaf nodes are assigned class labels or predicted values. Decision trees capture complex relationships and are interpretable. Techniques like pruning and ensembles help combat overfitting. They provide transparent if-then rule-based predictions.
